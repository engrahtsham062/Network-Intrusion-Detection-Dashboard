## Project Overview
The Network Intrusion Detection Dashboard is built using Power BI to provide insights into network traffic and security threats. This dashboard helps in analyzing attack patterns, monitoring traffic, and identifying vulnerabilities across different service protocols. The visualizations aim to assist in understanding the nature and frequency of network intrusions.

## Key Features and Visualizations
1. Total Records
Description: Displays the total number of network traffic records in the dataset.
Purpose: Provides an overview of the dataset size and the volume of traffic analyzed.
2. Total Attacks
Description: Shows the total number of attack records identified.
Purpose: Highlights the extent of security threats detected within the network.
3. Normal Traffic
Description: Displays the count of normal (non-malicious) traffic records.
Purpose: Differentiates between normal and malicious traffic to assess network safety.
4. Percentage of Attacks
Description: Shows the percentage of traffic records classified as attacks.
Purpose: Provides a quick overview of how much of the network traffic is malicious.
5. Percentage of Normal Traffic
Description: Displays the percentage of traffic records that are normal.
Purpose: Helps to gauge the overall health of the network by identifying the proportion of safe traffic.
6. Average Attacks Per Day
Description: Shows the average number of attacks recorded per day.
Purpose: Analyzes daily attack patterns and helps in identifying peak attack times.
7. Attack Types by Service Protocol
Description: Visualizes the distribution of different attack types across various service protocols.
Purpose: Identifies which protocols are most vulnerable to specific types of attacks.
8. Top Services Under Attack
Description: Lists the top services that are most frequently targeted by attacks.
Purpose: Helps prioritize security measures for the most attacked services.
9. Traffic by Service
Description: Shows the breakdown of network traffic by different service types.
Purpose: Analyzes the usage of various services and identifies any unusual patterns.
10. Protocol-wise Attack Counts
Description: Displays the count of attacks categorized by network protocol.
Purpose: Helps to understand which protocols are more prone to attacks.
11. Attack Trend Over Time
Description: A line chart showing the trend of attack occurrences over time.
Purpose: Monitors the frequency of attacks over different time periods, highlighting any spikes or patterns.
12. Evolution of Attack Types by Year
Description: Visualizes how different attack types have evolved year by year.
Purpose: Tracks changes in attack methods and helps predict future trends.
## Usage
Interactivity: Use filters and slicers to interact with the data and analyze specific time periods, protocols, or attack types.
Drill-Through: Click on specific data points to drill through and view detailed information about specific attack events.
Export: Export the visuals and insights for reporting and decision-making purposes.
